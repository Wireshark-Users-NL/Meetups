## Wireshark Updates
### By Sake Blok, member of the Wireshark Foundation Advisory Committee

Over the past years the Wireshark Foundation Advisory Committee has worked behind the scenes to enhance the organisational side of the Wireshark foundation. There will be a short update on the current state of the foundation.

There have also been some significant changes to Wireshark itself. Sake will run you though some of the things that have changed (and might not be too obvious), so you can put them to your advantage.

## Hacking with Wireshark
### By Stan Overgauw, member of Rabobankâ€™s Red Team.

In this session Stan will showcase different ways hackers can (ab)use Wireshark to attack your organization. For example social engineering based on MAC Address, harvesting IPC traffic, why SSL/TLS offloading can be a bad idea and (ir)responsible troubleshooting privileges.

And a demo: from network TAP to local admin!
