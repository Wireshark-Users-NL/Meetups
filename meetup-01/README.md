## Creating a perfect configuration profile
### By Sake Blok

In this session Sake showed how to build a (protocol based) configuration profile that will make your Wireshark Analysis a lot more efficient. Topics included changing Wireshark's layout, columns, filter buttons, colors, protocol preferences etc. Real life examples will be used to show the power of configuration profiles.

## Collecting packets in complex infrastructures
### By André Luyer

In this session André used some cases to show how packets can be captured in different scenarios. Knowing when to capture on an endpoint, a firewall, loadbalancer, with a span-port, a tap or a packet broker can be crucial in making sure you capture the right packets to find the root cause of the issue you are investigating.
